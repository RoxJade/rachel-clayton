# 1. UX

## 1.1 Target Audience
The site is aimed towards art lovers who have an appreciation for abstract art, design and print. It's likely that the audience will be above the age of 25 and earning a reasonable wage, to afford the artwork. 
In most cases the audience will be visiting the site to find 1-2 art pieces. The audience will be looking for a unique and original, hand printed design that makes a statement within their interior.
The audience will value the orignality and authenticity of their artwork, rather than a reproduction or imitation.

## 1.2 User Stories

<img alt=user_stories src="readme-images/user_stories.png" width=100%>

## 1.3 Business Goals
Rachel would like to showcase herself as an independent professional designer, specialising in screen printing. 
She would like a gallery to display her designs and the opportunity to sell them and make a profit. 
Each print is screen-printed by hand in Rachel's UK-based studio and therefore, unique and individual. 
I would like my brand to communicate as a professional, independent designer.

## 1.4 Design

To design the site, I consulted closely with the business owner, Rachel, on all design decisions. Rachel chose the logo and typeface from the selection of designs below, she also advised on the colour palette she wanted. 
She gave me a selection of sites to look at for inspiration including [Jonathan Lawes](https://jonathanlawes.com/), [Lucy Merriman](https://www.lucymerrimanart.com/) and [Georigia Elliott](https://www.georgiaelliottartist.com/).
She would like the design of the site to be minimal and sophisticated with the emphasis on the products, her print designs.

# 3. Features

## A list of some of the main features within the site:

- A selection of 20 print designs, created by Rachel to appear as a gallery or grid within the site.

- A filter system in the site navigation links that returns specific sizes and types of artwork.

- An email subscription mailing list, using MailChimp, providing users to leave their email address, which gets saved to the user subscription list within MailChimp. From there, Rachel can send marketing emails to her subscribers.
    
- A completely styled admin interface for the store manager to be able to add, edit, remove products, change details and upload images, allowing Rachel full control over managing her new products and adding new lines.

- A fully functioning payment system to purchase Rachel's artwork. The ability to purchase products form the site using the Stripe payment system, which takes payments for the products and processes them.
    - **Purchase using test card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 (any numbers can be entered for YY/MM CVC)**

- Include's the calculation UK VAT of 20% that must be applied to each of Rachel's print's for purchase.

- Customer's who have placed orders will receive a confirmation email detailing their order.

- A contact form built into the contact page to allow for customers, collaborators and commission requests to be sent directly to Rachel's email address (this is currently registered to my email address for testing purposes.)

- Full user authentication (register/login/sign in/email verification), for personal profile/account to hold delivery information and purchase history. 

- A range of messages to pop-up on the site and return specialised responses based on user interaction.

- Delivery, shipping and returns information to inform customers who plan to or have purchased a print.

## Future Scope for Development:

Areas of the project I'd like to improve on and develop:

- There are still tweaks to be made to the site, design features and layouts I feel I can improve.
- in the future I would like to add a customer gallery, where customers can unload their own photos of Rachel's purchased artwork, possibly with a review section.
- I would also like to build more sections that could be useful for Rachel, as the business owner it would be great if she could have a styled admin where she manage customer orders, as well products.
- Eventually Rachel would like to start posting her work out to countries other than the UK. Therefore I could look into adding some payment functionality to support this.

# 4. Deployment

1. I created and named my new app on Heroku.

2. Going back to Gitpod: 
    - I installed **dj_database_url** and **psycopg2-binary** with these commands in the terminal: 
        - `pip3 install dj_database_url`
        - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
    - I added these packages to my requirements file with `pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.`
    - Then pushed them to my GitHub repository.

3. Preparing to setup database:
    - I dumped my Categories and Products data into json files with the following commanads:
    - `python3 manage.py dumpdata products.Category > categories.json, python3 manage.py dumpdata products.Product > products.json`

3. Back in Heroku:
    - In the resources tab, I selected the **postgres database**. 
    - This generated the **DATABASE_URL** which can be found in the config vars, which I later added to **settings.py**.

4. In Gitpod, settings.py file:
    - I imported dj_database_url into my settings.py with `import dj_database_url`
    - Then 'commented-out' the default Django database settings and added the Heroku Postgres **DATABASE_URL**:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<DATABASE_URL here>")
    }
    ```
5. In the Gitpod terminal:
    - I ran migrations to create the models for my database with: 
        - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
        - `python3 manage.py migrate`
    - Then loaded the data fixtures into the categories and products model (in that specific order) with:
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata categories`
        - `python3 manage.py loaddata products`
    - I created a superuser for the main site with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

6. In settings.py, **before committing**, I made sure to 'uncomment' the default Django database settings and **remove the DATABASE_URL** to prevent it from saving to version control and created an if/else conditions for when to use each database:
``` if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    } 
``` 

7. Back in the Gitpod terminal:
    - I installed **gunicorn** with `pip3 install gunicorn`
    - Added it to my **requirements.txt**
    - I created a Procfile with the following text: `web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application` for the gunicorn server.
    - I **disabled 'collectstatic'** using `heroku config:set DIABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app rachel-clayton` to prevent Heroku from collecting the static files upon deployment.

8. In settings.py I added: `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['rachel-clayton.herokuapp.com', 'locahost']` to allow access to the Heroku site.
    - I then pushed the changes to GitHub and to Heroku using: 
        - `heroku git:remote -a rachel-clayton`
        - `git push heroku master`

9. Connecting Heroku to GitHub 
    - On the deploy tab in Heroku, I clicked **Connect to GitHub** as my deployment method and searched for my repository to **connect** with it. 
    - I then selected **Automatic deployments** so my the changes I make in development are pushed to Heroku as well.

10. I added all keys and values to the Heroku config vars needed for the project to run, **replacing two keys** that were in my version control commits. These were:
    - Django SECRET_KEY, which I replaced in settings.py with: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')`
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASS (committing this one to version control was an accident!)

    | KEY            | VALUE         |
    |----------------|---------------|
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<aws access key>`  |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<aws secret access key>`  |
    | DATABASE_URL| `<postgres database url>`  |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<email address>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_API_KEY| `<api key>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER| `<datacenter id>`  |
    | MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID| `<emailist id>`  |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<stripe public key>`  |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<stripe secret key>`  |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<stripe wh key>`  |
    | USE_AWS | `True`  |
    
11. Finally, I added a condition to debug, only in development with: `DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ`. 

## Hosting static and media files with AWS
All of my static and media files are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To do this, I created an S3 bucket, set a group, policy and user in the IAM environment. Then loaded all of my media files and static files into it.
