 - As the business owner, I would like to receive email confirmations of customer orders.
 - As the business owner, I would like to be shown how to view and manage customer orders. 

## 1.4 Design

To design the site, I consulted closely with the business owner, Rachel, on all design decisions. 
She gave me a selection of sites to look at for inspiration including [Jonathan Lawes](https://jonathanlawes.com/), [Lucy Merriman](https://www.lucymerrimanart.com/) and [Georigia Elliott](https://www.georgiaelliottartist.com/).
She would like the design of the site to be minimal and sophisticated with the emphasis on the products, her print designs. Based on my research, I selected a range of sophisticated fonts and developed a selection of logo designs and a minimal colour palette for Rachel to choose from.
