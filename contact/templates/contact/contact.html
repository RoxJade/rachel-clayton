                    <p class="lead mt-3 mb-0 text-left">Rachel is a screen printer and artist based in Bristol. After
                        graduating with a BA (Hons) in Printed Textiles and the Decorative Arts from Middlesex
                        University, she then worked as a freelance textile designer for a few years. It was after this
                        that she decided to move towards more personal pieces of work created on wood, paper, and
                        acrylic.

                <p>Alongside working as an artist and designer, Rachel has been a lecturer in both further
                    and higher education for twenty years. Her work is inspired by geometric shapes and pattern
                    found in her surrounding environment, and she has a strong fascination for colour and texture.
                    Her work often has a textile link through the use of surface and the relationships with shapes.
                    Rachel is drawn to architecture and the industrial landscape, which is often where her creative
                    identity derives from, as well as being inspired greatly by specific abstract artists, both 2D
                    and 3D. She often works intuitively, playing with interacting shapes and complimentary textures,
                    being aware of composition, contrasts and negative space. The work is predominately silk screen
                    printed, but there are also monoprint and collage techniques within some pieces, where there is
                    the need to insert a particular texture or image.
                    From conception of idea to the initial drawing and mark making stages, then the creation of
                    positive imagery onto screens, onto the actual printing process; each screen print can take days
                    to produce. Each piece of work is an original.
