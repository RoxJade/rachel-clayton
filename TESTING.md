# 6. Development and Problem Solving and Bugs

**Navbar**

When designing the navbar I had a few issues with spacing as the client wanted wide letter spacing on the navlinks. This caused a few more problems with the layout on responsive screens. To solve this, I had to add some additional media queries. 
I also found a bug on the navbar toggler icon. Upon clicking, it created a red border around the icon. After researching I found that this was a built in bug from Bootstrap and I found some custom css, from a blog, to remove the border - [Border around burger - Cyrill](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/border-around-burger-menu-button/#post-13131740):
<br>
``` CSS
* {
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(236, 12, 12, 0) !important; 
    -webkit-focus-ring-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) !important; 
    outline: none !important;
}
```

<img alt=burger-border src="readme-images/testing-images/burger-border.png" width=30%>

----------

**Logo issues - extending to other templates**

Once I had created the base.html with the navabr and footer for the site, I used {% extends "base.html" %} in other templates, to load the navbar and footer through the site. 
However, the brand logo svg file did not load properly. After looking at the terminal, I realised that it was being searched for in the wrong file path, causing a 404 error and broken image. 
I researched into this on the [Django docs - Static files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/) and realised that the logo.svg needed to be stored in Static directory, rather than in the Media folder. 
To solve, I created an img folder in the static directory and dropped logo.svg in, then I altered my file path in base.html, from:
<br>
`<img class="brand-logo" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}media/logo-lg.svg" alt="Rachel Clayton | print">` 
<br>
to 
<br>
`<img class="brand-logo" src="{% static 'img/logo-lg.svg' %}" alt="Rachel Clayton | print">` 
<br>
Then it worked fine across all templates.

<img alt=logo-issue-products src="readme-images/testing-images/logo-issue-products.png" width=70%>
<img alt=logo-issue-path src="readme-images/testing-images/logo-issue-path.png" width=30%>

**Later on...** I realised the reason this wasn't working was due to the fact that I had not included the `media context processor` in my settings.py file. 
I added this later but chose to leave the logo in it's static/image directory as this worked and was an acceptable solution according to Django docs. 

----------

**Creating a view for calculating VAT**

----------

**Small typo that tested a try/exception block**

Whilst creating the 'remove_from_bag' function, I was confronted with an error 500 status, (from the try/except block I had added in the bag view). 
This acted as a mini-test for my code and describde the error in the terminal as a missing 'forward slash'. I knew that the typo had to exist in the 
javascript as the post method wasn't working and the error was well described. After searching through, I found and added the missing '/'.
This accidental mistake tested my try/exception block in the bag views succesfully and helped me to resolve the issue. 

----------

**Image upload issues**

After creating the models for the database, I added the product photos. Once they uploaded in the Django admin database, I noticed their file names changed. I tried reloading them but it didn't make any difference. As the images were still working correctly, I left the issue for a while. 
However, once I deployed the project to Heroku and loaded the image files to the AWS S3 bucket, they didn't have the correct file links for the images. To solve this, I edited all of the file names to match correctly in the deployed site. 
This solution worked, but after researching into the Django docs, I found the resason why this happens and a more suitable solution to use future. [It can be found here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#filefield).

----------

**Minor Bug Fix**

After deployment, I realised a site user could still add a 'sold' item to their bag. To fix this, I created an if/else condition to prevent the 'add-to-bag' button from being seen if the item was 'sold'.

----------

**Stripe Issues**

    - I found adding Stipe to the project fairly straight forward, with one exception. After stopping the Gitpod workspace for a while and re-opening, some of the 'Â£' signs in the chcekout and bag views had changed to '$' signs. I checked I had set my currency on Stripe to GBP, which was correct. 
    Once I changed these back in the HTML tenplates, this solved the issue and has not occurred since, however, I did find there were some occurrences of it happeneing to other users on the Slack Community and it was suggested the issue stems from Stripe.

    - I used Crispy forms to create and validate the all of the forms in the site. I appreciated the time it saved with minimal styling needed and the validation completely handled. 
    On the checkout page however, the field for country would not allow users to enter 'UK', it has to be 'GB'. This was not quite as user-friendly as I would have liked, it's something I'd like to alter in the future. For now, I added a small sentence in the placeholder to inform users to use GB instead UK.

----------

**Accidentally commit EMAIL_HOST_PASS password into version control**

Whilst working to develop the contact app, I accidentally committed and pushed my code to my GitHub repo whilst the Gmail `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` password still existed in my settings.py file. 
I made sure to replace this upon deployemnt, at the same time as replacing the Django `SECRET_KEY`. I then added them both to the config variables in Heroku.
